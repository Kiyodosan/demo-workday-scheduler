# Demo Workday Scheduler

___

## Project Description

This is a day scheduler with time slots between the typical work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. The current day is displayed at the top and time slots are displayed below for each work hour. Text can be written in each time block and the text data can be saved if desired, even when the user refreshes the page.

The time slot's color is dynamically determined based on the current time:
Past: Grey
Present: Red
Future: Green

## How to use this project

The current day can be viewed near the top of the page at the bottom of the header. This day is displayed in real time.

The user can click inside of a text box (between the time and the save button) to write down whatever they wish. Clicking the save button on the right of the text box will save the text in local storage. Any text that is saved in local storage will persist upon page refresh.
